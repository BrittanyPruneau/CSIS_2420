// Applications of geothermal heating include: 
// Geothermal heat pumps
// Bathing and Swimming
// Space Heating
// Greenhouse heating 
// Aquaculture pond heating
// Industrial Heating
// Snow Melting
// Agriculture Drying

// Geothermal for HEATING is the direct use of geothermal energy for some heating applications. Humans have 
// taken advantage of geothermal heat this way since the Paleolithic era. Approximately seventy countries 
// made direct use of a total of 270 PJ of geothermal heating in 2004. As of 2007, 28 GW of geothermal heating 
// capacity is installed around the world, satisfying 0.07% of global primary energy consumption.[1] Thermal 
// efficiency is high since no energy conversion is needed, but capacity factors tend to be low (around 20%) 
// since the heat is mostly needed in the winter.
// Geothermal energy originates from the heat retained within the Earth since the original formation of the 
// planet, from radioactive decay of minerals, and from solar energy absorbed at the surface.[2] Most high 
// temperature geothermal heat is harvested in regions close to tectonic plate boundaries where volcanic activity 
// rises close to the surface of the Earth. In these areas, ground and groundwater can be found with temperatures 
// higher than the target temperature of the application. However, even cold ground contains heat, below 6 metres 
// (20 ft) the undisturbed ground temperature is consistently at the Mean Annual Air Temperature[3] and it may
// be extracted with a ground source heat pump.

// Geothermal for ENERGY  
// an explanation of each type              https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/electricity-generation 
// Geothermal power is electrical power generated from geothermal energy. Technologies in use include dry steam power stations, 
//flash steam power stations and binary cycle power stations. Geothermal electricity generation is currently used in 26 countries,
//[25][26] while geothermal heating is in use in 70 countries.[27]
//As of 2019, worldwide geothermal power capacity amounts to 15.4 gigawatts (GW), of which 23.86 percent or 3.68 GW are installed 
//in the United States.[28] International markets grew at an average annual rate of 5 percent over the three years to 2015, and global 
//geothermal power capacity is expected to reach 14.5–17.6 GW by 2020.[29] Based on current geologic knowledge and technology the GEA 
//publicly discloses, the Geothermal Energy Association (GEA) estimates that only 6.9 percent of total global potential has been tapped 
//so far, while the IPCC reported geothermal power potential to be in the range of 35 GW to 2 TW.[7] Countries generating more than 15 
//percent of their electricity from geothermal sources include El Salvador, Kenya, the Philippines, Iceland, New Zealand,[30] and Costa Rica.
//Geothermal power is considered to be a sustainable, renewable source of energy because the heat extraction is small compared with the 
//Earth's heat content.[21] The greenhouse gas emissions of geothermal electric stations are on average 45 grams of carbon dioxide per 
//kilowatt-hour of electricity, or less than 5 percent of that of conventional coal-fired plants.[27]
//As a source of renewable energy for both power and heating, geothermal has the potential to meet 3-5% of global demand by 2050. 
//With economic incentives, it is estimated that by 2100 it will be possible to meet 10% of global demand.[30]
