//Small wind turbines may be used for a variety of applications including on- or off-grid residences, telecom towers, offshore platforms, 
//rural schools and clinics, remote monitoring and other purposes that require energy where there is no electric grid, or where the grid is unstable. Small wind turbines may be as small as a fifty-watt generator for boat or caravan use. Hybrid solar and wind powered units are increasingly being used for traffic signage, particularly in rural locations, as they avoid the need to lay long cables from the nearest mains connection point.[70] The U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) defines small wind turbines as those smaller than or equal to 100 kilowatts.[71] Small units often have direct drive generators, direct current output, aeroelastic blades, lifetime bearings and use a vane to point into the wind.
//Larger, more costly turbines generally have geared power trains, alternating current output, and flaps, and are actively pointed into the wind. 
//Direct drive generators and aeroelastic blades for large wind turbines are being researched. 

// Horizontal Axis wind turbines 
//Large three-bladed horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWT) with the blades upwind of the tower produce the overwhelming 
//majority of wind power in the world today. These turbines have the main rotor shaft and electrical generator at the top 
//of a tower, and must be pointed into the wind. Small turbines are pointed by a simple wind vane, while large turbines generally use a wind sensor coupled with a yaw system. Most have a gearbox, which turns the slow rotation of the blades into a quicker rotation that is more suitable to drive an electrical generator.[28] Some turbines use a different type of generator suited to slower rotational speed input. These don't need a gearbox and are called direct-drive, meaning they couple the rotor directly to the generator with no gearbox in between. While permanent magnet direct-drive generators can be more costly due to the rare earth materials required, these gearless turbines are sometimes preferred over gearbox generators because they "eliminate the gear-speed increaser, which is susceptible to significant accumulated fatigue torque loading, related reliability issues, and maintenance costs."[29] There is also the pseudo direct drive mechanism, which has some advantages over the permanent magnet direct drive mechanism.[30][31]

//to the U.S. for assembly.
//Most horizontal axis turbines have their rotors upwind of the supporting tower. Downwind machines have been built, 
//because they don't need an additional mechanism for keeping them in line with the wind. In high winds, the blades 
//can also be allowed to bend, which reduces their swept area and thus their wind resistance. Despite these advantages, 
//upwind designs are preferred, because the change in loading from the wind as each blade passes behind the supporting 
//tower can cause damage to the turbine.
//Turbines used in wind farms for commercial production of electric power are usually three-bladed. These have low torque 
//ripple, which contributes to good reliability. The blades are usually colored white for daytime visibility by aircraft and 
//range in length from 20 to 80 meters (66 to 262 ft). The size and height of turbines increase year by year. Offshore wind turbines 
//are built up to 8 MW today and have a blade length up to 80 meters (260 ft). Designs with 10 to 12 MW were in preparation in 2018,[32] 
//and a "15 MW+" prototype with three 118 meters (387 ft) blades is planned to be constructed in 2022.[33] Usual multi megawatt turbines 
//have tubular steel towers with a height of 70 m to 120 m and in extremes up to 160 m.

// Vertical Wind Turbines 
// Vertical axis

//A vertical axis Twisted Savonius type turbine.
//Vertical-axis wind turbines (or VAWTs) have the main rotor shaft arranged vertically. One advantage of this arrangement is 
//that the turbine does not need to be pointed into the wind to be effective, which is an advantage on a site where the wind 
//direction is highly variable. It is also an advantage when the turbine is integrated into a building because it is inherently 
//less steerable. Also, the generator and gearbox can be placed near the ground, using a direct drive from the rotor assembly 
//to the ground-based gearbox, improving accessibility for maintenance. However, these designs produce much less energy averaged 
//over time, which is a major drawback.[27][34]
//Vertical turbine designs have much lower efficiency than standard horizontal designs.[35] The key disadvantages include the 
//relatively low rotational speed with the consequential higher torque and hence higher cost of the drive train, the inherently 
//lower power coefficient, the 360-degree rotation of the aerofoil within the wind flow during each cycle and hence the highly 
//dynamic loading on the blade, the pulsating torque generated by some rotor designs on the drive train, and the difficulty of 
//modelling the wind flow accurately and hence the challenges of analysing and designing the rotor prior to fabricating a prototype.[36]
//When a turbine is mounted on a rooftop the building generally redirects wind over the roof and this can double the wind speed at 
//the turbine. If the height of a rooftop mounted turbine tower is approximately 50% of the building height it is near the optimum for 
//maximum wind energy and minimum wind turbulence. While wind speeds within the built environment are generally much lower than at 
//exposed rural sites,[37][38] noise may be a concern and an existing structure may not adequately resist the additional stress.
