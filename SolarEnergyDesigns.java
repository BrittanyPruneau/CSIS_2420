// Passive Solar Architecture
// Solar architecture is an approach to design with an emphasis on harnessing the sun’s power 
// (usually through solar panels) to create energy-efficient buildings. By incorporating these 
// green practices in design, architects can help address the climate crisis head-on. And it doesn’t 
// hurt that solar panels can lower monthly electricity costs.

//Passive Solar Heat Sinks 
// How The Heat Sink Works
// For larger greenhouses with plenty of room, the most popular water vessel is the 55-gallon drum, 
// either black plastic or painted flat black. 
// Again, you need an insulation board installed on the north wall prior to adding a bank of barrels. Then line up each barrel, 
// fill with water, oil, or dense rocky material and seal.
// As temperatures drop at night, the heat absorbed by the water vessels 
// is radiated back into the greenhouse. When properly done, the 
// temperature inside the greenhouse stays an average of 20 to 30° 
// warmer than outside, even in the dead of winter!

// Passive solar technologies convert sunlight into usable heat and cause air movement for 
// ventilating to heat and cool living spaces without active mechanical or electrical devices.

// Passive Solar Water Heater 
// Passive solar water-heating
// In the passive solar water-heating system, solar collectors are used to heat the water. 
// Technologies including FPCs, ETCs, integrated collector storage allied to a CPC, and the 
// photovoltaic/thermal (PVT) system can be used. The basic elements of the system include the 
// collector, piping, and hot water tank. The heat transfer from collector to storage tank occurs 
// through the natural convection principle. An electrical pump is not needed.

// Active Solar Water Heater
// Active solar space- and water-heating
// In the active solar space- and water-heating systems, the solar collectors transfer the heat to 
// the heating system through pumps or fans. Nontracking solar collectors are enough for these demands. 
// Sometimes the space- and water-heating functions are integrated in one system. The heating systems can 
//use the solar heat directly or through heat exchange processes. Water or air is used as a transport medium.
